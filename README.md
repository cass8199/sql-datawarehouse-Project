üöÄ **Project Requirements**

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications
* Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as is from the source systems. Data is ingested from csv files into SQL server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This Layer includes data cleansing, Standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
