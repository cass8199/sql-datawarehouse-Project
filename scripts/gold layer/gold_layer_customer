======================================================================================================================================
The gold.dim_products view is a dimensional product table created from source data in the silver layer. It consolidates product-related 
information from two tables: silver.crm_prd_info (product information) and silver.erp_PX_CAT_G1V2 (category details).

Key points:

Primary Purpose: To generate a clean and enriched product dimension for analytical and reporting purposes.

Product Key: A surrogate key (product_key) is generated using ROW_NUMBER() ordered by product start date and product key to ensure uniqueness and maintain consistency.

Join Logic: A LEFT JOIN merges product data with category data using the category ID.

Filters: The view only includes active products (prd_end_dt IS NULL), filtering out any products that have been discontinued or ended.

Fields Included: Product identifiers, names, costs, category info (main and subcategories), product line, start date, and maintenance flags are 
included for comprehensive dimensional analysis.

This view can be used in downstream reporting, analytics, or as part of a star schema for product-related insights.
