Primary Purpose: To generate a clean and enriched product dimension for analytical and reporting purposes.

Product Key: A surrogate key (product_key) is generated using ROW_NUMBER() ordered by product start date 
and product key to ensure uniqueness and maintain consistency.

Join Logic: A LEFT JOIN merges product data with category data using the category ID.

Filters: The view only includes active products (prd_end_dt IS NULL), filtering out any products that
have been discontinued or ended.

Fields Included: Product identifiers, names, costs, category info (main and subcategories), product line, 
start date, and maintenance flags are included for comprehensive dimensional analysis.
